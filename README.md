1. Background and motivation 
India is an agricultural country. Agriculture and its allied activities act as the
main source of livelihood for more than 80% population of rural India. It
provides employment to approximately 52% of labour.
One third of the country’s aquifers are being pumped “much faster” than
they can replenish. Of the 245 billion cubic meters of groundwater
consumed in India annually, 90% goes to agriculture.The north of the
country is particularly threatened by water shortages, according to CNN. In
2019, the four main reservoirs in the city of Chennai nearly ran dry because
of lack of rainfall.

2. Key problem solved 
India’s water crisis is constant. Although India has 16 per cent of the world’s
population, the country possesses only four per cent of the world’s
freshwater resources. India is water-stressed due to changing weather
patterns and repeated droughts.As many as 256 of 700 districts in India have
reported ‘critical’ or ‘over-exploited’ groundwater levels according to the
most recent Central Ground Water Board data.Using Pijuice and solar panels

we can keep our Raspberry Pi running 24/7 and keeping it uninterrupted
from power cuts.
Hence the smart irrigation system will help us to utilize water without
wasting a single drop of water.As soon as the moisture of the soil hits the
minimum level required the water stops pumping thereby saving water that
would otherwise be wasted if irrigation was done manually.
